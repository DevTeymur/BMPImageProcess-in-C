# BMPImageProcess

The main idea of this project is to create a program that allows adjusting the brightness and contrast of the BMP image automatically. To obtain solid results the process should be done by obeying specific rules. To modify the brightness the minimum value of all RGB pixels will be subtracted from all pixels. Multiplying pixels by the maximizing factor which is gained by dividing the maximum brightness by the maximum RGB values allows obtaining maximum contrast in the image.
